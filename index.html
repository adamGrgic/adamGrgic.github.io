	<!--- Introduction Paragraph --->
	
	<p> The rapture is upon us! Everyone we know and love is about to be erased from existence unless we can produce a hero to <strong>play dice against the devil</strong>. What is your name, sir/madam??</p>
	
	<form>
		 What is your hero's name? <br>
		Character Name:
		<input type="text" id="characterName">  
		City:
		<input type="text" id="characterCity"> <br>
		<button onclick="createCharacter()"> Submit </button>
	</form>
	
	
	
	<p> The world as we know it is being torn asunder, and you, user, are confronted by the devil himself. In his wretched hoof hands, he holds the key to the planet's salvation: a six-sided di. </p>
	
	<!--- the six sided di will expand and become more complex as the user gets further into the story -->
	
	<p> If you think you have what it takes to save the world, then by all means take the devils challenge. But fair warning, you are our last hope and if you lose, the universe will fall to the devil's evil minions, and cease to exist! </p> 
	
	
	
	<!--- Enter the Devil --->
	
	<p> Bow down puny mortals! The end is here! <strong>Do you think you have what it takes to play dice with the prince of darkness? </strong></p>
	<br>
	<p> The rules of the game are as follows, puny mortal: you will be given a six sided dice. You are to roll this dice three times per round--the goal is to roll a higher number than myself. IF, however, you roll a 6 (my favorite number, muahaha) than you have to subtract that number from your total. If you roll three 6's at any point in the game, then my minions will encapsulate this pathetic planet and you will LOSE! </p>
	<br>
	<p> To make things fair I have done you the favor of revealing your personal sanity bar above your head. As your sanity decreases, the complexity of the dice increases and therefore the frequency of 6's. </p>
	<br>
	<p> roll the dice puny mortal.</p>
